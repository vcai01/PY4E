Exercise 1: Write a simple program to simulate the operation of the grep command on Unix. Ask the user to enter a regular expression and 
count the number of lines that matched the regular expression:
"""

import re
name = input('Open file: ')
hand = open(name)
word = input('Enter a regular expression: ')
count = 0
numlist = list()
for line in hand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if re.search(word, line):
        count += 1
print(name, 'had', count, 'lines that matched', word)
